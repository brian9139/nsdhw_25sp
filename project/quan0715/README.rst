Proposal: RTSEngine R-Tree Search Engine (Draft)
==========================================

Basic Information
----------------

**Project Name**: R-Tree Spatial Search Engine  
**Goal**: Develop a high-performance R-Tree engine for multi-dimensional spatial data indexing and querying.  
**Overview**: I'll implement the R-Tree data structure and algorithms with a clean API for spatial indexing. This project combines my interests in data structures and spatial computing.
**GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/quan0715/RTSEngine
.. note::
   This is an initial draft proposal. Details will be refined as the project progresses.

Problem to Solve
---------------

Efficient retrieval of multi-dimensional spatial data is crucial in GIS, game development, scientific computing, and robotics. Current challenges include:

- Traditional one-dimensional search structures don't work well for multi-dimensional space
- Brute force methods become inefficient as data volume increases
- Existing solutions (k-d trees, quad-trees) have limitations with higher dimensions or dynamic updates

R-Trees offer advantages through balanced structure, support for various spatial entities, efficient updates, and optimized range queries.

Prospective Users
---------------

- **GIS Developers**: For indexing geospatial entities and performing proximity queries
- **Game Developers**: For collision detection and spatial scene management
- **Robotics Developers**: For environmental perception and navigation

System Architecture
-----------------

**Core Components**:

1. **R-Tree Data Structure (C++)**
2. **Spatial Entity Management**: For points, lines, polygons, and volumes
3. **Query Engine**: Range, point, and nearest-neighbor queries
4. **Serialization Layer**: For persistence
5. **Python Bindings**: Using pybind11

**Constraints**:

- Limited to 2-3D spatial dimensions
- Unique integer identifiers for each entity
- Configurable branching factor

API Description
-------------

**C++ API**:

.. code-block:: cpp

    // Create an R-Tree
    RTree<T, D> tree(branchFactor, splitStrategy);
    
    // Basic operations
    bool insert(int id, const SpatialEntity& entity);
    bool remove(int id);
    bool update(int id, const SpatialEntity& newEntity);
    SpatialEntity* getById(int id);
    
    // Queries
    std::vector<int> searchRange(const BoundingBox& range);
    std::vector<int> searchNearest(const Point& point, int k);
    std::vector<int> searchIntersect(const SpatialEntity& entity);
    
    // Serialization
    bool saveToFile(const std::string& filename);
    bool loadFromFile(const std::string& filename);

**Python API**:

.. code-block:: python

    # Similar functionality with Pythonic interface
    tree = RTree(dimension=2, branch_factor=16)
    tree.insert(id=1, entity=Point(10, 20))
    results = tree.search_range(min_point=[0,0], max_point=[20,20])

Engineering Infrastructure
------------------------

- **Build**: CMake with single-command build
- **Version Control**: Git with feature branching
- **Testing**: Google Test (C++) and pytest (Python)
- **Code Quality**: Following Google C++ Style Guide and PEP 8
- **Dependencies**: STL, pybind11, minimal external libraries

Documentation
-----------

- API reference for both C++ and Python
- Installation and quick-start guides
- Basic examples and performance benchmarks
