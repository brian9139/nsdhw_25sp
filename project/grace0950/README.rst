 HyperTS: High-Performance Time Series Analysis and Forecasting
################################################################

*******************
 Basic Information
*******************

**GitHub repository:** https://github.com/grace0950/HyperTS

******************
 Problem to Solve
******************

Time series data is essential in finance, meteorology, and engineering.
Efficient analysis and forecasting of time series data are crucial for
making smart decisions. However, existing Python solutions like
``pandas`` and ``scikit-learn`` often face performance bottlenecks when
handling large datasets.

This project aims to solve the following problems:

-  **Slow computation:** Python is not optimized for large-scale time
   series calculations.

-  **High memory usage:** ``pandas`` struggles with managing memory
   efficiently for long time spans or high-frequency data.

-  **Lack of optimized numerical methods:** Some algorithms, like Kalman
   Filter and Fourier Transform, are not well-optimized in Python,
   affecting performance.

Mathematical and Algorithmic Foundation
=======================================

-  **Kalman Filter:** For real-time estimation and state prediction.
-  **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT):** For frequency-domain analysis and
   pattern recognition.
-  **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA):** For forecasting
   trends in time series data.

*******************
 Prospective Users
*******************

This system is designed for professionals and researchers working with
time series data:

-  **Financial Analysts:** Stock price prediction, market trend
   analysis.
-  **Data Scientists:** Sensor data analysis, predictive modeling.
-  **IoT Engineers:** Efficient processing of real-time sensor data.
-  **Weather Researchers:** Climate data analysis and weather
   forecasting.

Users can interact with the system through a **command-line interface
(CLI)** and a **Python API**.

*********************
 System Architecture
*********************

The system is modular, using **C++** for high-performance computation
and **Python** for ease of use and data visualization.

Workflow
========

-  **Input:** Accepts time series data from CSV, JSON, or a database.

-  **Processing (C++ Core):**
      -  Implements FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), Kalman Filter, and
         ARIMA for data analysis.
      -  Uses multi-threading to speed up computations.

-  **Interface (Python API & CLI):**
      -  Allows users to configure analysis settings.
      -  Provides visualization tools using matplotlib.

-  **Output:** Saves results as JSON or CSV and can generate charts if
   needed.

Modules
=======

-  **Core Processing (C++11):** Optimized numerical computations for
   high performance.
-  **Python Interface:** High-level wrapper for user-friendly
   interaction.
-  **Data Handling:** Manages file reading, writing, and data
   validation.
-  **Visualization:** Plots trends and patterns using graphs.

*****************
 API Description
*****************

The system provides both a **command-line interface (CLI)** and a
**Python API** for flexible usage.

Command-Line Interface (CLI)
============================

Users can run time series analysis directly from the command line.

.. code:: bash

   # Run FFT on input data
   ./timeseries_processor --input data.csv --method fft --output fft_result.json

   # Run Kalman Filter, allowing custom noise parameters
   ./timeseries_processor --input data.csv --method kalman --process-noise 0.001 --measurement-noise 0.01 --output kalman_result.json

   # Use ARIMA to predict 10 steps, specify model parameters (p=5, d=1, q=0)
   ./timeseries_processor --input data.csv --method arima --order 5 1 0 --steps 10 --output arima_forecast.csv

Python API
==========

The Python API allows users to integrate the system into their own
projects.

.. code:: python

   from timeseries import TimeSeriesProcessor

   # Load time series data
   processor = TimeSeriesProcessor("data.csv")

   # Apply FFT
   fft_result = processor.fft_transform()

   # Apply Kalman Filter
   kalman_result = processor.kalman_filter(process_noise=1e-3, measurement_noise=1e-2)

   # Forecast using ARIMA
   arima_forecast = processor.arima_forecast(order=(5, 1, 0), steps=10)

   # Save results
   processor.save_results("output.json")

CSV Data Format
===============

``data.csv`` is the input file for time series processing. The format
should follow these rules:

A CSV file must have at least two columns:

-  ``timestamp``: The time label for each data point.
-  ``value``: The measured value at that time.

Example:

.. code:: csv

   timestamp,value
   2025-03-17T12:00:00,0.5
   2025-03-17T12:00:01,0.7
   2025-03-17T12:00:02,0.2

-  The ``timestamp`` must be in **ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DD
   HH:MM:SS`)** or **Unix Timestamp (seconds/milliseconds)**.
-  The ``value`` should be a floating-point number or an integer.
